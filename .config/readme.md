## Explaination
- **.Xmodmap** <br>This file lets me have natural scrolling on MacBookAir.

- **.i3status.conf** <br>I use polybar but have configuration for the i3bar incase I want to switch back

- **.bashrc** <br> Contains my config for the bash shell. It also contains some aliases which I find usefull

- **~/script/term.py** <br> Is a very usefull script. I have a keyboard shortcut (```mod+enter```) which runs this script. What this script does is that if the currect workspace is empty, then it will open my terminal which ```termite``` as floating enabled. If there is a window in the current workspace, then the terminal will open like other windows

- **.ncmpcpp** <br> There are a few conficurations for it. I like all of them and switch between them from time to time 

- **~/.config/**
  - **audacious** <br> Just a simple config to make audacious minimal
  
  - **dunst** <br> Some configuration for my notification deamon that I took from somewhere
    
  - **gtk-3.0** <br> Here you will find ```gtk.css``` which adds paddings for vte-based terminal and ```settings.ini``` which setts my gtk theme and the icons
  
  - **i3** <br> Basic configuration for the ```i3-gaps``` window manager. The only keybinding that might be needed to be noted is that ```mod+x``` launches ```i3lock-fancy```
  
  - **polybar** <br> In this folder you will find a file called ```config``` which has some neat configurartion and file called ```launch.sh``` which is script which used to start polybar
  
  - **ranger** <br> Minimal configuration for my cli file manager which also lets view the images in the terminal. But there is a small bug which makes the images sometimes not render properly
  
  - **rofi** <br> A random color scheme which does not really fit the rest the configs. Its better than plain white which is the deafult I guess
  
  - **termite** <br> My termite terminal emulator configuration. The color scheme is the ocean-next color scheme with but the background color is gotton from pywal-web
  
- **var/spool/cron/siddharth** <br> Configuration for my cron jobs

- **.vimrc** <br> Just a simple vimrc. Nothing special her.
