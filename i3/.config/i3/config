##### RULES FOR SOME PROGRAMS #####
# Exmaple:
#   Spotify will open in workspace 4 only on launch.
#   This wont effect any other Spotify windows. For example,
#   Lets say that I have a Spotify window in workspace 2, when I 
#   relaod i3, it will still stay there. These rules only apply
#   to new windows which have been launched.
