# Switching the keybindings for reload and rotate
# because I personaly reload my documents more than
# I rotate them. So having reload binded to r seems
# more practicle
map r reload
map R rotate

default-bg "#000000"
# In MuPDF, i is the keybinding to invert the color
# and I rather stick with that binding
map i recolor

set statusbar-home-tilde
