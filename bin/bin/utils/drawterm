# Just a fun script which allows you to draw terminals into your screen
#

# Draw a box which will be where the terminal will be
read -r X Y W H < <(slop -f "%x %y %w %h" -b 1 -t 0 -q)

# Launch the terminal with custom title so that i3wm can
# make it float by default
kitty  --title="kitty-float" &

# Need to wait for i3wm to make the window floating
sleep 0.245

# Resize the window
xdotool windowsize $(xdotool getactivewindow) "$W" "$H"

# Move the window 
xdotool windowmove $(xdotool getactivewindow) "$X" "$Y"
