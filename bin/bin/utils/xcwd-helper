#!/usr/bin/env bash

#
# A script that only allows xcwd to be used for opening a terminal from certain applications.
# If the current window is Discord, the xcwd will return '/usr/bin/' and that's not where we
# want to open our terminal. So 'xcwd' only works properly when launching while our focused
# window is a terminal such as Alacritty. Thunar used work, but no longer works.
#
# Example usage:
#   alacritty --working-directory=$(xcwd-helper)
#

current_dir="$(xcwd)"
allowed_program_classes="Alacritty"
active_window_class=$(xdotool getactivewindow getwindowclassname)

if ! printf %s "$allowed_program_classes" | grep -q "$active_window_class"; then
    printf %s "$HOME"
    exit
fi

printf %s "$current_dir"
